Objective:
To analyze textual data, such as product reviews, and classify sentiments (positive or negative) using NLP techniques.

Key Highlights:
Real-World Dataset: Utilizes Amazon Food Reviews dataset, a practical dataset with genuine user feedback.
Natural Language Processing: Implements text cleaning, feature extraction, and sentiment classification.
Machine Learning Model: Employs a Naive Bayes classifier for efficient text classification.
Data Visualization: Provides insights into data distribution and model performance.
Deliverables:
A Python-based end-to-end notebook demonstrating:
Data preprocessing (cleaning and labeling).
Data visualization.
Model training and testing.
Performance metrics (confusion matrix, accuracy, and classification report).
